# Spatial Nearness and Spectral Similarity Trade-Off in Hyperspectral Image Classification andExtensions to Open-Set Agricultural Applications

This is the official repository that contains the data and code that accompany the methodology submitted to the IEEE Journal of  Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing (JSTARS). This is provided for reproducibility.

### Description:
Classification of Hyperspectral images (HSI) obtained from aerial sensors to estimate the land cover usage pattern using Machine Learning (ML).

### Value
The exercise of using classifying the land per the crop type using HSI, will enable us to understand the growing pattern, land usage, soil con-ditions, water access, human activity mapping and others,are  important  steps  in  the  goal  to  meet  the  challengesin  anticipated  food  production

### Data
Hyperspectral Imagery (HSI) refers to hundreds or even thousands of such bands captured in much narrower (10-20 nm) bands, offering very rich spectral information. Each such image is, in reality, a three-dimensional (3-D) volume with each voxel (3-D pixel) having both position information in the X and Y coordinates, and the spectral information content embedded in the Z direction
